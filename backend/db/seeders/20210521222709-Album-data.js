It reimagines the songs of The National, a genre-defining indie rock staple for people of Bartees' generation. Strange — a black artist from Mustang, Oklahoma — uses everything from the cover art to his reading of the lyrics to allude to how black artists can find room in white spaces. The EP is both a heart-felt homage and a political act of critique. And it sounds like it was made with energy, intelligence & love.", createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },

Given the circumstances, loneliness, isolation, feeling & focus, Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska felt like an appropriate cipher for the moment. When I listen to the songs on Nebraska I think about justice & justification; the absence of the former and the ever-churning of the latter, as present as the tape hiss on the Tascam the record was performed on. I think about complicated lives lived by complicated people in complicated situations. I think about peace & fear & hope & a lack of options...", createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },

Living in different cities during quarantine, we took these opportunities to keep making music together - from home. Over the past few years, various arrangements of Worriers have played cover sets of bands like Fleetwood Mac, Minor Threat, Green Day, and The Lemonheads, so covers have always been a fun extra-curricular activity for us. This collection brings together songs from some of our favorite and most influential bands.", createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },
