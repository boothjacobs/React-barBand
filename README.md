# BarBand

[BarBand](https://bar-band.herokuapp.com/) is a Bandcamp clone for cover songs.

A BarBand user has a "collection" of saved albums. Collections can be added (from the album page) and deleted (from the collection page), and each album in a collection displays how many other collections it belongs to.

Clicking on an album from the collection, home page, or search results brings the user to an album page, which lists the tracks and their original artists, and features an audio player. The album page also offers commenting for logged in users with full CRUD.


(Future updates will include original recording artists as a database model and the ability to "follow" artists to show them on the home page on login)
