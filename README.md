# BarBand

BarBand is a Bandcamp clone for cover songs.

A BarBand user has a "collection" of saved albums. Clicking on an album from the collection, home page, or search results brings the user to an album page, which lists the tracks and their original artists.

Minimum viable product goals for next Friday are the user collection page, album pages, and search (by artist, original artist, or song)

(Future updates will include original recording artists as a database model, a song player, and the ability to "follow" artists to show them on the home page on login)

Database schema is here and included in the "docs" folder.
